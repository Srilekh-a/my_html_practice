        <h3>What is a Virtual Environment?</h3><br>
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most Python developers use.

<h3>Why do we need a virtual environment?</h3><br>
Imagine a scenario where you are working on two web-based Python projects one of them uses Django 4.0 and the other uses Django 4.1 (check for the latest Django versions and so on). In such situations, we need to create a virtual environment in Python that can be really useful to maintain the dependencies of both projects.
